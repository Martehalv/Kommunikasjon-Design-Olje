          One of those workers is Brede, who spent seven years on board the
          vessel
          <strong>Island Wellserver</strong>, a specialized ship built for
          servicing and repairing oil wells on the seabed. While on board
          between 2011 and 2018, Brede helped ensure that the flow of oil and
          gas remained steady and safe.
        </p>
        <p>
          “I started as an <span class="rlwi">RLWI</span> operator, which is
          working directly with the equipment used on the seabed. And in 2015, I
          became the shift leader on board,” he says.

          Each mission lasted two weeks, which means being on board of the ship
          for two weeks at a time, and then getting two weeks off on land. The
          Island Well carried between 60 and 70 crew members at a time.

          “It was a very social life on the ship. Sometimes maybe a little too

          The crew’s main task was to maintain and test the systems that control

          “We used hydraulics, oil and other fluids to operate the tools at the
          bottom,” Brede explains. “We also worked with electronics and
          computers to monitor everything. The main goal was to make sure the
          wells functioned properly, and that oil and gas could be produced
          safely.”

      <p class="intro-text">
        To most of us, the process of pulling oil from deep beneath the ocean
        floor may seem complex. Brede explains it simply:
      </p>

      <p class="quote">
        “First, a drilling rig makes a hole through the seabed. The hole can go
        as far as
        <span class="slide-number num5000">5000</span> or
        <span class="slide-number num6000">6000</span> meters deep. Then we
        insert pipes and steel casings to make it safe and stable. When we find
        where the oil is located, we make small, controlled holes in that layer
        of rock.”

          “There’s so much pressure down there that the oil rises on its own,”
          Brede says. “But we control it carefully with valves and pumps to make
          sure nothing goes wrong.”
        </p>
        <p>
          “When the oil reaches the surface, it goes through a quick cleaning
          process. What comes up can be a mix of oil, water, and sand, so we do
          a light separation before sending it off for proper treatment and
          storage.”

        <p>
          Working offshore means dealing with risk. But on Norwegian vessels,
          safety is taken extremely seriously.
        </p>

        <p>
          “Norway has some of the world’s best safety systems,” Brede says
          firmly.

          “We trained regularly for every possible situation. If anything
          serious happened, there was always a helicopter ready to help nearby.”
        </p>

        <p>
          During his seven years at sea, Brede never experienced any major
          accidents, but the work was still dangerous.
        </p>

        <p>
          “Working high up on the ship was one of the biggest risks,” he
          recalls.
        </p>

        <p>
          “We often had to repair large pieces of equipment before lowering them
          into the sea, which meant climbing tall structures or cranes on deck.
          You always had to be careful.”
