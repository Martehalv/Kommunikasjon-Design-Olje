          Far out in the North Sea, surrounded by nothing but wind and open
          water, hundreds of people live and work for weeks at a time on large
          offshore vessels. These ships form a vital part of Norway’s oil and
          gas industry, maintaining the wells and pipelines that keep the
          country’s energy production running.

          One of those workers is Brede, who spent seven years on board the
          vessel <strong>Island Wellserver</strong>, a specialized ship built
          for servicing and repairing oil wells on the seabed. While on board
          between 2011 and 2018, he helped ensure that the flow of oil and gas
          remained steady and safe.

          “I started as an <span class="rlwi">RLWI</span> operator, which is

          became the shift leader on board,” he says.

        To most of us, the process of pulling oil from deep beneath the ocean

      </p>

      <p class="quote fade-in">
        “First, a drilling rig makes a hole through the seabed. The hole can go
        as far as <span class="slide-number num5000">5000</span> or
        <span class="slide-number num6000">6000</span> meters deep. Then we
        insert pipes and steel casings to make it safe and stable. When we find
        where the oil is located, we make small, controlled holes in that layer
        of rock.”

        <p>
          During his seven years at sea, Brede never experienced any major
          accidents, but the work was still dangerous.
        </p>

        <p>
          “Working high up on the ship was one of the biggest risks,” he
          recalls.
        </p>

        <p>
          “We often had to repair large pieces of equipment before lowering them
          into the sea, which meant climbing tall structures or cranes on deck.
          You always had to be careful.”
