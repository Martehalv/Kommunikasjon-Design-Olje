          One of those workers is Brede, who spent seven years on board the
          vessel
          <strong>Island Wellserver</strong>, a specialized ship built for
          servicing and repairing oil wells on the seabed. While on board
          between 2011 and 2018, Brede helped ensure that the flow of oil and
          gas remained steady and safe.

          “I started as an <span class="rlwi">RLWI</span> operator, which is
          working directly with the equipment used on the seabed. And in 2015, I
          became the shift leader on board,” he says.
